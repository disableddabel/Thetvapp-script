Steps to Extract M3U Links (Legally & Safely):
1️⃣ Inspect Network Traffic (Browser DevTools)


Open DevTools in your browser (Right-click → Inspect → Network Tab).
Navigate to thetvapp.io and play a stream.
Filter network requests by XHR/Fetch or look for files ending with .m3u8.
Copy the URL for the stream, which might look like:
https://cdn.thetvapp.io/streams/channel123/index.m3u8
2️⃣ Fetch M3U Links via API
If thetvapp.io provides an API:
NOTE THIS IS NOT A WORKING VERISON
Check their developer documentation or contact support for API access.
Use the provided API to fetch stream links programmatically.
Example Python snippet:

import requests

# API Configuration
BASE_URL = "https://thetvapp.io/api/v1/streams"
TOKEN = "your_api_token_here"  # Replace with your token

headers = {"Authorization": f"Bearer {TOKEN}"}

# Fetch channels
response = requests.get(BASE_URL, headers=headers)
if response.status_code == 200:
    data = response.json()
    for channel in data['channels']:
        print(f"Name: {channel['name']}, URL: {channel['stream_url']}")
else:
    print("Failed to fetch streams:", response.status_code)
3️⃣ Generate M3U Playlist
Transform the extracted URLs into M3U format:

#EXTM3U
#EXTINF:-1 tvg-logo="http://logo.png",Channel 1
http://stream1.m3u8
#EXTINF:-1 tvg-logo="http://logo2.png",Channel 2
http://stream2.m3u8
⚠️ Important Notes
